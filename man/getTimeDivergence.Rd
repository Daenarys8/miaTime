\title{Beta diversity calculation between samples at the interval of n time steps}
\usage{
getTimeDivergence(
  se,
  sample_field,
  sample_id,
  time_field,
  time_interval,
  transposed = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{A
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{SummarizedExperiment}}
object or
\code{\link[TreeSummarizedExperiment:TreeSummarizedExperiment-class]{TreeSummarizedExperiment}}}

\item{sample_field}{column vector containing the all individuals in
\code{colData} field}

\item{sample_id}{character indicating a individual inside of \code{sample_field}}

\item{time_field}{column vector containing the time information
in \code{colData} field}

\item{time_interval}{integer value indicating the increment between the time
steps. It can be 1 or higher than 1.}

\item{transposed}{logical scalar assigning samples to rows if they are in
columns. If samples are not in rows, the default value is applied.
(default: \code{transposed = FALSE})}
}
\value{
a matrix containing the beta diversity and time difference
between samples in n time steps
}
\description{
The dissimilarity (beta distance) is calculated in steps of n between the
samples of subject. "n" can be 1 or greater than 1. The time difference
between the n points is also calculated.
}
